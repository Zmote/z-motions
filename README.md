# ZMotions

This webpage isn't finished, even if I've already deployed it already. I needed a portfolio up as soon as possible. Will optimize code and fix issues as time permits. Just a heads up. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `ng build:prod` script for a production build or
`ng build:gh-pages` for Gitlab Pages production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Publishing on Github Pages

Run `npm run publish:gh-pages`

This builds the project and deploys the build dist dir to a branch called gh-pages with the appropiate deployment URL.
(in this case the repo name as prefix)
